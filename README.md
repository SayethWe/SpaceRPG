# SpaceRPG

A text adventure RPG about ekploring a decrepit ship. Designed to be very hard. It follows several tenets:

1.) Permadeath. If a character dies, that character is gone
2.) Shared/persistent World. Any changes made stick around, including lotted rooms and your corpses
3.) Limited Randomness. RNG will generate the world, then get out of the way. No runs should be ruined if you miss that shot
4.) Story Creation. Hopefully, a procedurally written story doc will be created as you create characters and explore.
