Document Title: SS Greenshift.
Begin Content.
	The SS Greenshift is the prototype lead ship of the Greenshift class Stellar Transporters.
	Built mainly as a test bed for a new Coherent Radiation Shift engine, the Greenshift class is to have two sister classes.
	1.) The Maneuverable Warships of the Gammashift class, with members Uniform-Victor, X-Ray, and Golf-Romeo,
	and
	2.) The High-Capacity Haulers of the Radioshift class, with members  India-Romeo, Mike-Whiskey, and Romeo-Whiskey.
	Greenshift has been chosen as the first to be built, due to being the most 'Renaissance' ship, enabling trials of both capacity and speed.
